This project involves building a Transformer from scratch. 

## Introduction

The Transformer is a popular deep learning model architecture that has been widely used in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. In this project, we will dive into the details of the Transformer model and implement it from scratch.

## Features

- Implementation of the Transformer architecture
- Training the model on a specific task
- Evaluation and analysis of the model's performance
